Despite their necessity to our academic lives, it often seems that USC printers are never working when we need them to. Every day, students scurry across campus desperate to print their final essays or resumes, only to find that every printer they visit is in need of maintenance. Printh is a client-server system that provides USC students with the status of every printer on campus that accepts a Print Card, each of which is located in the lobby of a residence college. With this app, students can check to see if their local printer is working, and if not, they can plan to print at a nearby working printer. The information provided by this app is sourced by CSC staff and other students, who can easily use the app to report if a printer is broken or has been fixed, allowing for the most accurate data to be presented on the app. The app was built in RFO-BASIC, a high-level programming language for android apps, while the server for this information is managed by a python script.
